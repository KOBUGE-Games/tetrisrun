# DEV


## Technical choices

* Runner stays at horizontal coordinate 0, the environment moves. Tests have to be done to know what type of physics node runner needs to be.


## Notes

* Fixed level is here as a testing mean, the endless level will be the actual gameplay

## Arbitrary choices

This section is to document arbitrary choices who may be reworked

* Screen is 1024x600, default
* Runner is 50x50
* Tiles are 100x100
* Runner starts at 150,375, allowing 3 tiles under it

## Placeholder art

This section is to document arts which aren't meant to be definitive but just here as placeholder

* Everything ATM.

## TODO 

Almost everything...
