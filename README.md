# Tetrisrun

WIP for game off 2017

## Gameplay
2D sideview infinite runner / tetris-oid

The runner is a ball rolling from left to right.
The camera is fixed on the runner.

The player doesn't have control over the runner, it just keeps running without interuption until stopped or eliminated by the environment.

The player can put tetris shaped blocks on the terrain to prevent the environment from stopping the runner.
